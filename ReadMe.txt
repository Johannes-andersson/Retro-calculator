# Curved Display Calculator

Curved Display Calculator is a Python-based application that combines a visually engaging user interface with advanced plotting capabilities. It features a retro, Matrix-style welcome screen and allows users to perform 2D, 3D, and diagram plotting of mathematical expressions using Python's powerful libraries.

## Features

- **Retro Curved Display:** A visually appealing interface with a green, wave-style welcome message on a black background, reminiscent of old terminal screens.
- **2D Plotting:** Generate 2D plots of mathematical expressions.
- **3D Plotting:** Create 3D surface plots using advanced mathematical functions.
- **Diagram Plotting:** Display bar charts based on user input for data visualization.
- **Interactive Input:** Users can enter their own math expressions and visualize the results instantly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyQt5** - For the graphical user interface.
- **OpenGL** - For rendering the retro display effect.
- **Matplotlib** - For 2D and 3D plotting.
- **NumPy** - For handling mathematical computations and array operations.

Using the Calculator

Upon launching, youâ€™ll be greeted with a retro-style welcome message.
Enter your desired mathematical expression in the input field at the bottom.
Choose the type of plot you want to generate: 2D Plot, 3D Plot, or Diagram.
Click the Plot Graph button to visualize the expression.
Examples of Valid Math Expressions
2D Plot: np.sin(x) - Plots a simple sine wave.
3D Plot: np.sin(np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)) - Creates a 3D surface with a ripple effect.
Diagram: [10, 20, 15, 5] - Displays a bar chart with the given values.

Troubleshooting
Missing Imports: If you encounter errors regarding missing functions or modules, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
Display Issues: If the graphics do not render correctly, make sure your system's OpenGL drivers are up-to-date.
